# Introduction
The concept of gender equality can be traced back to the late 18th century after the Enlightenment, which brought about new ideas and beliefs on individual rights and freedoms. Gender equality is a concept centered on equal opportunities and rights for people of all genders, irrespective of their biological sex.
